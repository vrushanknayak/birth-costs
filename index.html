      <p>Despite <a href="https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2018/">reports</a> of decreasing air pollution levels in the United States, there is still widespread concern about how air quality may be affecting our
        health. On Wednesday the World Health Organization released a report that connected air pollution to many health risks and even death. </p>

      <p> The <a href="http://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga_2019_report.pdf">report</a> estimates that air pollution caused 4.9 million deaths in 2017, about 8.7 percent of all deaths across the year. Effects of living in
        polluted areas include higher chances of lung cancer, respiratory and heart illnesses. But scientists believe that even lower levels of air pollution can be dangerous.
        The danger of fine particulate matter affects public health across the globe. While the World Health Organization guideline for healthy air is 10 mcg, in the United States the EPA annual standard is 12 mcg.</p>

      <p>“The fact that the EPA sets those standards doesn’t mean that levels below those standards are necessarily safe,” said Dr. Marianthi-Anna Kiomourtzoglu, a professor at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.
      </p>
      <p> “We have more and more studies that show as air pollution levels decrease, at levels below the standard we still see highly harmful effects,” said Kiomourtzoglu.
        But for Kiomourtzoglu and others in the field, higher air pollution will always be associated with higher risk.
